This C++ program performs several text processing tasks. Here's a breakdown of its functionalities:

1. **Counting Letters and Characters:**
   - The program defines functions to count vowel and consonant letters in a given text.
   - Special characters are also counted, and the counts are stored in vectors of pairs.

2. **Sorting and Printing Special Characters:**
   - The special characters are sorted by count in descending order, and the sorted list is printed.

3. **Starting Characters and Words:**
   - The program prints the starting characters of words along with their counts.
   - It also prints the starting word of each sentence with its count.

4. **Encryption and Decryption:**
   - The program encrypts the text by replacing words with random numbers. The encryption table is stored in a file (`encrypted_text.txt`).
   - It then decrypts the encrypted text back to the original words using the stored encryption table.

5. **Word Compression and Decompression:**
   - The program compresses words in the text that are longer than 5 characters and occur more than 2 times. The compressed text is stored in a file (`compressed_words_text.txt`).
   - It then decompresses the compressed words back to the original words using a decoding table.

6. **Roman Numeral Conversion:**
   - The program converts a set of Roman numeral characters to Arabic numerals and prints both representations.

7. **User Interaction:**
   - The user is prompted to enter a text, and the program performs the specified operations on that text.
